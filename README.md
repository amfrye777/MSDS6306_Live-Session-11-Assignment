Data was gathered and cleaned from the below site:
    http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004916.html

Two files were produced 
* DeathPenaltyStatsNotMerged.csv
* DeathPenaltyStatsMerged.csv

The Merged file was merged to the dataset1.sas7bdat file provided in 2DS.

*Please note:* there are some extra 'states' in the death penalty data from the website, and one missing value - be sure to accommodate for this appropriately!! :)
